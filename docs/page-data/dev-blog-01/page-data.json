Though, we didn\\u2019t want to have a magic system that is used in other games. We wanted to stand out: to be unique. From the get go we knew we didn\\u2019t want to have some sort of on-screen button to cast magic, or a turn-based system. That was an idea tossed out right from the bat since we wanted to bring to life the game as much as possible. Having a turn-based system would stifle that.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Sometime during the first meeting when we agreed upon a game idea, as a team we decided that this game would have some kind of drawing system. What that would exactly be, we didn\\u2019t know at the time. It was tossed in initially that it would potentially be turn-based combat, but we still wanted to have an element of combat-freedom. Where the player could freely move to dodge the attacks of enemies while trying to attack enemies at the same time. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This would be something that makes our game stand out; our unique game mechanic to the game that hooks players in. There were a couple of initial references off the bat for this mechanic: the old Harry Potter games (you draw the spell on the lower DS screen with the stylus); and even the Pok\\xE9mon Ranger series: where in Guardian Signs there are specific signs for different legendary Pok\\xE9mon. Having all of this in mind helped us come up with a prototype, which was shown off at one of our meetings two weeks into the project.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Through the prototype and discussing the initial creation, we decided as a team it would be best to have fluid gameplay. The first prototype felt a bit clunky, and we came around to the idea that maybe when you cast a spell, there\\u2019s a certain window of opportunity you have to use the spell. Like a cooldown where the spell is active. Eventually, that would be where we work in a mana-system: you can have multiple active spells that you can cast by tapping on the screen. However, every tap of the screen costs an amount of mana. When the timer ends for the active spell, you can no longer cast it and have to re-draw the spell. This is our current design of the spell-drawing system, and it checks off everything we want with it. Free movement, unique gameplay, utilizes the phone\\u2019s touch screen, and brings a unique challenge to becoming the best witch/wizard in the game. To be the best you need to master drawing spells, but also managing all the resources it takes to cast them, and knowing where to tap on the screen. It\\u2019ll be really interesting to see where our spell-drawing system takes players as we move forward with the future plans we have in mind with a tournament system.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our initial beta-testing rounds showed us just how tricky calculating for differen screen sizes is. One tester would see the spell hexes easily where another would see gaps between the hexes. This caused a bit of trouble, which took at most a week or so to solve (keep in mind we are students, so this amount of time is fine). A recent meeting had one of the devs proposing that the amount of hexes that are available to draw with increases, and the size of the hexes decrease. This would be a way to increase the amount of unique spells that we are able to draw, as well as make it a bit easier in translation of the screen resolution. They got the go ahead to work on this, since it was a really great idea. There are a lot of spell symbols we need done, and with so many hexes, we could get a lot of unique shapes in.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"We\\u2019re all really happy with where our spell drawing system currently is. There will be more improvements to come as well as potential updates to the idea if our design isn\\u2019t up to standard.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"All of this is really exciting.
