## Spellrise Team

We are a group of University students varying from different years. We're making a game for a club, and are inspired to make this game into a great piece of content. From an arrange of backgrounds, we were paired together as we joined UBC Game Development's project teams and have been working together collaboratively to bring the vision of the game to life. We are hard-working, communicative, cooperative and willing to receive feedback at every step of the way to improve. We're constantly looking for ways to improve ourselves and parts of the project that we work on.
